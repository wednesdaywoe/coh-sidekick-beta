"""Exporter source fingerprints — the anchor of the export-staleness guard.

`exported_powers/<dataset>/` (and its `tables/` subtree) is produced by the
Python bin parser reading the gitignored `.pigg` archives. CI has no archives,
so unlike `src/data/datasets/*/generated/` (which regenerates from committed
`exported_powers/`), these exports CANNOT be regenerate-and-diffed in CI.

The failure this closes: a change to the parser (e.g. `_powers.py`,
`_classes.py`) that ships WITHOUT a matching re-export, so the committed JSON is
stale relative to the parser and every downstream fix is inert. The powers tree
bit twice (the 2026-07-06 tspy hybrid relabel; the incarnate converter
regenerating one dataset); the `tables/` tree was the WS3 gap — kept in sync
only because CLASSES-1 happened to regenerate it, guarded by nothing going
forward.

The guard: each exporter (`export_powers.py`, `export_classes.py`,
`export_entities.py`, `export_salvage.py`) stamps its output dir with a manifest
recording that exporter's SOURCE fingerprint at export time. The guard that
grades them is `tools/export-integrity.py` (`npm run audit:export-integrity`),
whose `staleness` check recomputes the same hash from the committed sources and
asserts every dataset's manifest matches. It is not a CI job: it runs locally,
and as the FIRST step of `scripts/regen-all.cjs`, ahead of every converter that
treats the export as ground truth. If the parser changed but a dataset was not
re-exported, its recorded fingerprint diverges from the current source and the
guard goes red; the only
way to make it green is to actually re-export (which re-stamps).

Scope: every `.py` in the package — `parser/**/*.py`, the exporter entry
modules, and the helpers beside them. It is a directory GLOB, not a curated
allowlist (the project keeps burning on hand-maintained allowlists), so it is
self-maintaining as files come and go.

**The glob used to stop at `parser/` plus one entry module, and that was a
hole.** `export_powers.py` imports `path_safety.py`; every exporter imports
`assets_dir.py`; `export_entities.py` imports `export_powers.py` itself. None of
those were covered, so a change to the path rule or the source resolver changed
what the exporter WRITES with no staleness gate to notice — recorded as
deliberately unfixed in F78's row, and closed here because the digest work below
was paying for a re-export anyway. The cost of widening is near nothing: the
non-parser modules took 1–3 commits each over six months against `parser/`'s 63,
so parser churn already dominates when a re-export is forced.

It intentionally OVER-covers, and now maximally so: all five fingerprints fold
the same file set and are therefore EQUAL by construction. The five names and
the five manifest keys stay because each still answers a per-surface question
("is THIS tree current?") and the manifest schema is read by two guards; what
they no longer do is differ. A `_powers.py` edit forces a harmless
classes/entities/salvage re-export and vice-versa (near-zero diff) — the
accepted trade for a glob nobody has to maintain. Modules an exporter never
imports (`server.py`, `preflight.py`) are swept in too; at their churn that is
cheaper than a rule deciding which imports count.


**The tax, stated so the next person is not surprised by it.** The fingerprint
is over source BYTES, so editing a comment in any `.py` here — this file, a
docstring in `path_safety.py`, anything — invalidates all eighteen manifests
and the only way back to green is re-running every export (about twenty-five
minutes across the four datasets). That was already true of `parser/**` and its
63 commits in six months; widening the glob extended it to a dozen quieter
files. It is the price of a glob nobody maintains, and it is paid in machine
time rather than in a stale guard nobody notices. Batch source edits, then
re-export once.

The salvage surface (`export_salvage.py` → HC-only
`exported_powers/salvage.json`, stamped alongside as
`salvage_export_manifest.json`) is HC-only: Rebirth/Thunderspy piggs carry no
`salvage.bin`, so those exports early-return and no manifest is written.

The manifest carries a second, independent record alongside these fingerprints:
`source`, the assets tree the bytes were read from (`BinResolver.provenance()`,
graded by the `provenance` check in `tools/export-integrity.py`). A fingerprint
says which exporter ran; it cannot say what it was pointed at —
DATA-GAP-REGISTER PROV-1.

The algorithm: sorted (posix-relpath-from-bin_crawler, file-bytes) folded into
sha256 as `relpath\\0content\\0` per file. There is deliberately no second
implementation to keep in lockstep. This module used to require one — a
TypeScript twin that "MUST replicate this algorithm byte for byte", warning that
a divergence would surface as a permanently-red guard. That twin was never
written. `tools/export-integrity.py` imports `_fold` from here instead, which
deletes the failure mode rather than managing it.
