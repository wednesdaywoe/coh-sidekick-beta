"""Export the salvage catalog (salvage.bin) as JSON for the planner.

Emits one record per salvage item with name, resolved display name, icon,
rarity, and category (invention / base / reward / incarnate). The planner's
`convert-salvage.cjs` consumes this to generate the incarnate + invention
salvage registries.

salvage.bin is HC-only (Rebirth's pigg has no salvage.bin), so this exports a
single flat file: exported_powers/salvage.json.

Usage:
  py -3 -m bin_crawler.export_salvage [--assets-dir DIR] [--output DIR]
