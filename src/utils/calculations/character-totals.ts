 *
 *  - The geometry — a sphere or cone with a bounded `maxTargets` — is that pass's own

 *    `Execute_Power` redirect branch, where the increment counts something else entirely
 *    (Reactive Regeneration's stacks count how recently you were hit, on a `SingleTarget` toggle
 *    with no sphere at all), and a floor there would assert a combat state rather than a seat in
 *    a sphere.
 *  - The recipient list — the converter's `selfIsCountedTarget`, `Power::affects_caster` in the
 *    engine — is what makes the caster one of those seats. It is the same term
 *    `firstTargetExcluded` uses to decide the value AT one target, so the two halves of "N = 1 is

 * carries it (109/102/114/109, none at the power level). The pseudo-pet ability records that
 * spell it a second way are not powers and never reach this path.
 *
 * Absent reads false on both terms: no list is not a licence to credit the caster with a slot.
 *
 * The parameter is the three fields read, not a `PowerWithToggle`: the display's own slider asks
 * the same question of a plain `Power` (`getStackingInfo`), whose `effects` is the WIRE shape and
