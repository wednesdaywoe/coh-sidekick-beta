/**
 * BPORT11 cluster 2 — mez protection, read off the atoms, graded against the bag it replaces.
 *
 * The six MEZ types, Knockback/Knockup, `mezResistance`, Taunt and Placate all left the bag in
 * one pass, because they are one fold and one credit gate. As with cluster 1 the comparison is
 * only available before BPORT7's regen: the bag is the shadow oracle, and the regen that
 * empties the slot empties the oracle with it.
 *
 * Read PER PLAYER CLASS, which is the part a build-agnostic comparison cannot do. A protection
 * atom may fork on `casterArchetypes` — Rebirth's pool powers state identical arms per class
 * (AT-FORK-1) — and a raw read returns `undefined` exactly where the build's own arm exists.
 * The bag never had to care, because the converter wrote one slot per power with the fork
 * already collapsed into it; an atom reader has to resolve it or lose the value. So every
 * assertion here runs through {@link mezSourceFor}, the same resolution the call site uses.
 *
 * What the corpus says, measured over 213,735 power×class views:
 *
 *  - the six MEZ agree with the bag on all 36,780 carrier views, with nothing held by either
 *    side alone;
 *  - the Knockback/Knockup bag arm never fired once — every view it could have answered was
 *    one `kbProtectionValue` had already answered, which is what retires it, rather than a
 *    decision to drop it;
 *  - `mezResistance` agrees on all 8,760 carrier views of the keys this block routes to a
 *    global, and gains 2: Rebirth Weave's immobilize resistance for the two Kheldian classes,
 *    visible only through the fork resolution;
 *  - Taunt and Placate agree on all 4 and all 15;
 *  - `protRepel` is the one arm that moves numbers, and it moves them both ways: 202 agree, 71
 *    lose a credit and 15 gain one. `effects.repel` holds the repel a power INFLICTS, so Ki
 *    Push, Jet Stream, Hurricane and Repulsion Field were crediting the caster with protection
 *    equal to the push they deal out, while Increase Density — the example the retired block's
 *    own comment named — was one of the 15 the slot never carried;
 *  - `effects.protection` has no carrier anywhere, confirming BPORT1's zero-supply verdict from
 *    the data side as well as the supply side;
 *  - and `protTeleport` is gone, stat and read together (user decision, matching canonical). Its
 *    read was `effects.teleport` × 100 on a slot holding the teleport a power PERFORMS, so all
 *    127 credited carriers were teleport powers credited with protection equal to their own
 *    range. No power carries the protection-spelled row a corrected read would have needed.
 *
 * Mutation-tested five ways on the readers and the resolution: reversing `mezSlotValue`'s
 * larger-magnitude pick, dropping its sub-type key, and stopping `mezSourceFor` from resolving
 * the fork all go red. One does NOT, and it is reported rather than patched — removing
 * `mezSlotValue`'s `aspect === 'Res' || aspect === 'Str'` guard changes no answer, because 0 of
 * the corpus's 11,784 `Mez` atoms carry either face. Mez RESISTANCE is a `MezResist` row and
 * mez STRENGTH is a `specialBuff` row; both are separate effect types, not separate faces of
 * `Mez`, so that clause is a second filter over an empty population. It is correct to keep and
 * wrong to claim as tested.
 *
 * The cost of the per-class read is why the sweep below narrows: a power with no forked atom
 * answers identically for every class by construction, so it is measured once and the class
 * loop runs only for the powers that actually carry a `casterArchetypes` stamp. The narrowing
 * is asserted, not assumed — {@link forkedPowers} must be non-empty, or the whole fork axis
 * would be silently untested.
