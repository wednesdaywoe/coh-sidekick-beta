/**
 * BPORT11 cluster 5 — the last families, read off the atoms and graded against the bag.
 *
 * ToHit, +Damage, the self damage and recharge penalties, regen, recovery, MaxHP, stealth, the
 * accolade +MaxEnd, and the toggle end cost. Six of them agree with the bag on every carrier;
 * the four that do not are the four worth reading twice.
 *
 * **Defiance was being credited as a permanent +damage buff.** 68 powers carry a `damageBuff`
 * the reader declines, and every single one is defiance-only — Blaster secondaries whose
 * Defiance rows the bag projected into a slot the totals spend flat. The rejection has to be
 * spoken at the call site as well as inside the reader, because an absent atom read is
 * indistinguishable from the atom-less case a fallback serves, and the bag held the same value
 * one line down.
 *
 * **Ally buffs were being credited to the caster.** Retiring the regen and recovery data arms
 * drops 46 + 76 credits, and every one is a `reachesCaster`-false row: Adrenalin Boost,
 * Painbringer, Temporal Selection, Speed Boost. The bag slot is toWho-blind, so an ally's
 * +regen landed on whoever owned the power.
 *
 * **The Expression punt was safe only while the bag was there.** `resourceBuffValue` abstained
 * on any Expression-typed resource atom because the converter drops the `tick_chance`-0 ones
 * and `Expression ⟺ dropped` is false. Its stated reason was "safe either way: if the bag kept
 * it we fall back to the bag's value" — and the strip is exactly the change that makes the
 * other way unsafe, because abstention stops meaning "ask the bag" and starts meaning zero.
 * Measured before closing it: every Expression resource atom reaching the reader belongs to a
 * power whose bag KEPT the slot, and the reconstructed value equals the bag's on all 36. The
 * casualty avoided is Gamma Boost's +regen and +recovery on all four forks.
 *
 * **One stealth carrier leaves and it is not a stealth row.** 106 powers carry a bag `stealth`
 * the reader declines; 105 are the teleport family's `{translucency: …}` under a key this block
 * never reads, credited 0. The 106th is Assassin's Strike, whose four atoms are a Meta, two
 * Damage and a GrantPower — no stealth row anywhere — so its bag `stealthPvE/PvP` came through
 * a grant edge the atom reader does not follow. That is the grant-crossing question RB5-d owns,
 * not a gap in this reader, and it is a Click either way.
 *
 * ABSORB is absent from this file on purpose: it is the one family BPORT11 declined to carry.
 * See the block comment in the oracle and the ABSORB-4 residual.
 *
 * **BPORT13 restated the arms.** BPORT7 removed `power.effects`, so the bag half of every
 * comparison above is gone. Three different things follow, and lumping them together is how a
 * file like this quietly stops grading anything:
 *
 *  1. **Carrier counts survive their oracle.** `tohitBuff` agreeing with the bag on 874
 *     carriers and diverging nowhere is the same fact as the reader having exactly 874
 *     carriers, once the bag has none. Those arms are now one-armed censuses pinned per fork —
 *     per fork because a total is not a roster and cross-fork movement is the drift that
 *     actually happens here.
 *  2. **Populations defined BY the bag can still be restated, if the property is atom-side.**
 *     "68 declined damage buffs and every one is Defiance" was scoped by the bag holding a
 *     value; but `damageBuffIsDefianceOnly` is an atom reader, so the same claim is askable of
 *     the atoms directly. Same for the 46 + 76 ally-directed resource buffs, whose property
 *     was always `reachesCaster` being false.
 *  3. **Two arms genuinely lose their subject, and say so.** The Expression punt's 36
 *     agreements and 15 twin-routed carriers were counts of bag values; so was the stealth
 *     comparison's 341. Nothing on the atom side reconstructs which powers the bag once held,
 *     so those numbers retire in place, with the halves of each claim that ARE atom-side kept
 *     live below rather than retired alongside them.
