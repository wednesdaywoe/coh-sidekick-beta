"""What an export actually wrote — SECURITY_AUDIT.md F78, DATA-GAP-REGISTER PROV-1.

`_export_fingerprint.py` answers "which exporter ran" and the manifest's
`source` answers "which assets tree did it read". Neither answers the third
question, and it is the one `exported_powers/` most needs asked: **are the bytes
sitting in the tree right now the bytes the exporter wrote?**

Nothing hashed them. Every gate downstream — converter validation, contract
totals, regen-diff, the fixtures — consumes the export as ground truth and is
internally self-consistent with whatever it finds there, so an edit made to a
committed power file after the export is indistinguishable from a real parse.
That is the FLAGS-2 shape the mandate names, one layer lower: not a bad read
becoming authoritative, but a good read quietly amended afterwards.

The guard: each exporter records, in its own manifest, a `content_digest` over
every file it wrote, and the `contents` check in `tools/export-integrity.py`
recomputes it from the committed tree. A file edited, added, or deleted after
the export moves the digest and the gate goes red; the only green path back is
a re-export.

What this does and does not buy. It is not an attestation — a single committer
can always re-export or re-stamp. What it removes is the *silent* case: partial
re-exports, stray scripts, a bad merge, an orphan left behind by a category that
stopped existing. Afterwards those are a red gate instead of new ground truth,
and a deliberate amendment has to carry a changed digest in the same diff, where
a reviewer can see it. `path_safety.py` put it exactly: a bad write "leaves no
trace to find afterwards either". This is the trace.

Exactness comes from the write boundary, not from a walk. `ExportTree` is the
one door every exported file goes through, so the recorded set is what the
exporter wrote by construction — no glob, no subtraction, no allowlist of which
subtrees belong to whom. The gate has to rederive that set from the committed
tree and does so by nearest-enclosing-manifest (the surfaces nest:
`exported_powers/` holds `tables/`, `entities/` and the three sibling datasets),
which is a rule rather than a list, and disagreement shows up as a `file_count`
mismatch before it shows up as a digest mismatch.

The fold is `_export_fingerprint._fold`, shared rather than reimplemented, so
"hash a set of files" means one thing in this package — and the gate at
`tools/export-integrity.py` imports that same function rather than writing its
own, so there is no second copy to keep byte-for-byte identical. The TypeScript
twin this paragraph used to address was never written.
