/**
 * PROD6B-1/6B-2 — per-power projection fidelity gate.
 *
 * The engine's new `power_projection` block must equal the beta's own per-power calculators
 * (`calculatePowerEnhancementBonuses` + `calcThreeTier` + `calculateArcanaTime` +
 * `calculatePermaInfo`) that PROD6C–E will retire. This drives all three forks through the Rust
 * engine (wasm-node) on the SAME data-driven build the PROD5 dashboard gate uses (no fork proper
 * nouns — Rule 0), then diffs the engine's resolved execution three-tiers + ArcanaTime + perma
 * against the beta calculators, power by power. A row here means the engine and the TS calc
 * disagree on a fork's per-power math — exactly what must not ship before 6C swaps the surfaces.
 *
 * PROD6B-2 adds the granted buff/debuff magnitudes to the same diff. Their beta reference is
 * `resolvePowerMagnitudes` — the pure function extracted from `RegistryEffectsDisplay`, which
 * that component now calls (decision 2026-07-24, user-chosen: extract the real resolver rather
 * than reimplement it in the test, so the gate grades the code path the UI actually runs).
 *
 * PROD6B-2c adds the level sweep. Every fixture here builds at level 50, so a magnitude resolved
 * at a pinned 50 and one resolved at the build level looked identical to all of the above — the
 * blindness that let the pin through 6B-2. The last test re-runs the magnitude diff at a level
 * where the two answers differ.
 *
 * The engine runs via wasm-node (the browser `engine.ts` has no Node path), same as
 * `serverParity.test.ts`. The fixture is deliberately parallel to that gate but kept local so the
 * committed dashboard gate stays untouched.

 *  contributes only keys the base LACKS, because a colliding key means two simultaneous instances
 *  and overwriting the base with one of them would display a single misleadingly stronger effect.
 *  The beta records the loser as an `extraInstance` for its own row; `mode: 'replace'` is the
 *  mutually-exclusive case and overwrites on both sides, which is why it is skipped here.
 *
 *  They differ in one place only: what they ask for base PRESENCE. The engine asks the
 *  atom-projected base surface (`window_slots`, `effective.rs`' `conditional_delta`); the beta
 *  asks `power.effects`, which STRIP-1 emptied for every power on every fork. So the beta's
 *  collision test is universally false, every additive entry's copy fills in, and the resolver is
 *  handed the CONDITIONAL's atom for a key the power's own atoms carry.
 *
 *  That is class 1's shape one layer down, and it is why the rows below are not a value dispute:
 *  the two sides read different atoms. Measured 2026-09-08 over the four combat-state bodies —
 *  every one of the 980 rows is `off=undefined` (the base states nothing), an exact-value carrier,
 *  and `additive`; not one is a `replace` entry or a base-authored slot. Rebirth's
 *  `Greater_Psi_Blade` is the control: its `psionic_melee_insight` is `replace` on that fork
 *  alone, both sides overwrite, and it is the one fork with no row for that power.
 *
 *  `offBag` is the same power's bag with every toggle off, which is the base surface the beta CAN
 *  still see. A key absent there and present here is the fill-in; requiring the value to equal the
 *  entry's own authored copy is what keeps this from swallowing a genuine contribution.
 *
 *  Two of the four legs are not gradeable by this corpus, and saying so is the point of writing it
 *  down (mutation sweep 2026-09-08 — deleting either leaves the suite green):
 *
 *  * the `offBag` presence test can only fire where the toggles-off bag holds the key, and
 *    STRIP-1 left it holding none — every subject measures `baseBagKeys=0`. It is oriented to
 *    NARROW as the bag comes back, which is what keeps it from becoming the universally-true
 *    guard it exists to compensate for; until then the corpus cannot violate it.
 *  * the exact-value test decides WHICH entry is named, never whether the row routes: where two
 *    active entries claim one key (Dual Pistols' ammo clocks — `iceammo` 10s and `toxicammo` 8s
 *    on one `buffDuration`) the loser fails it and the winner still sets the key. Dropping it

 *  bag order while the beta resolver emits them in registry-group order, and row ORDER is the
 *  component's sort, not part of the resolution under test.
 *
 *  An "engine only" row is ACCEPTED only when the beta's own power object has no such effect key:
 *  that means the fork's beta converter dropped an effect the rebuild's parser recovered (the
 *  export is truth — the PROD5 pattern), not that the engine invented a row. If the beta HAS the
 *  key and still resolved no row, the two disagree about resolution and that is a hard delta.
 *
 *  "beta only" is a hard delta — the engine dropping a row the beta carries is an engine defect —
 *  with ONE adjudicated case: a bare `effectDuration` on a power where the engine typed a template
 *  the beta's bag has no key for. Both rows are then the SAME template read twice: the rebuild's
 *  parser recovered its attrib (tspy `Power_Build_Up` → `+Special: Stun`), while the beta's
 *  converter could only keep the duration it hung on. Accepting it needs that typed engine row as
 *  evidence, so a genuine engine drop — no typed row to point at — still fails.
 *
 *  `engineEffects` opens the SYMMETRIC case, and only when the caller can supply the engine's own
 *  copy of the bag (PROD6C-3h, the pool/epic partitions). The rule mirrors the engine-only one
 *  exactly: a beta-only row is adjudicated when the ENGINE's bag has no such key to resolve from,
 *  and stays a hard delta when it HAS the key and still resolved nothing — which is the actual
 *  engine defect this branch exists to catch. Without the bag the branch is unchanged, so every
 *  other sweep keeps failing on beta-only rows.
 *
 *  Both bags are DISPLAY bags (`buildDisplayEffects`), the same input each side resolves from,
 *  so "the engine has no such key" means the engine's dataset yields no such row rather than
 *  merely authoring it elsewhere. That also makes the third adjudication below possible: a row
 *  both sides resolve from a bare number, where those two numbers differ, is converter drift.
 *
 *  2026-08-19 oracle re-cut (the engine vendor moved the engine ahead of the FROZEN legacy
 *  dataset, and every red it opened classified as the legacy data being wrong against the
 *  export — see the per-cluster evidence in the b2 triage): the drift adjudication is
 *  generalized from bare numbers to whole authored slots ([`authoredSlotsAgree`]), in BOTH
 *  directions — a one-sided row whose key the two datasets author differently is drift too,
 *  including the case where the engine's own bag has no such key at all while the engine still
 *  resolved a row: that row came through the projection's deeper walk (a grant edge or mode
 *  redirect the legacy dataset folded into the power itself — Bio Armor's aura taunt is the
 *  canonical pair, legacy `taunt {scale 1.1}` on the stance vs the engine reading the granted
 *  aura's own scale-1 row, the TAUNT-1 own-beats-redirect rule). Rows the two datasets author
 *  IDENTICALLY keep failing hard, which is what preserves the gate's grip on resolution.
 *
 *  There is no linear-self-stack adjudication any more, and the reason is worth keeping. The
 *  legacy `withTargetsHit` multiplies only the keys its dataset's `stacksLinear` names, and
 *  that list used to be authored self-inconsistently: the converter's stacking classifier was
 *  a second hand-maintained copy of the routing rules, and it keyed a `Range|Str` template to
 *  `specialBuff` while the extractor put the VALUE on `rangeBuff`, so sentinel Aim's list named
 *  a key the bag had nothing under and omitted the one that did. Both datasets shipped it, so
 *  the rows were adjudicated on atom evidence instead. STACK-6 closed it upstream — the keys
 *  come from the router now — and the rows are plain greens, which is the bar the exit
 *  condition set. A row that needs the old adjudication is a regression, not an exception. */
