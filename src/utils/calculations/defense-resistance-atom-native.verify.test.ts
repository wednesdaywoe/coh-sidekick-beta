/**
 * BPORT11 cluster 3 — defence, resistance, debuff resistance and the self −Res penalty, read
 * off the atoms and graded against the bag they replace.
 *
 * Five per-type maps, four of which cross fork-resolved: rebirth's pool and armour powers state
 * identical defence and resistance arms per class (AT-FORK-1), and a build-agnostic read returns
 * `undefined` exactly where the build's own arm exists. Canonical hit that from the other side —
 * rebirth Weave reading 0 defence while every other fork read it — which is why the resolution
 * came across with the mez fold rather than after it.
 *
 * Measured over 18,239 power×class views, one per power plus the class fan-out for the powers
 * whose atoms actually fork:
 *
 *  - `debuffResistance` 1,319 carrier views agree, nothing on either side alone;
 *  - `resistance` 1,606 agree;
 *  - `resistanceDebuff`, restricted to the self-tagged entries the call site keeps, 17 agree;
 *  - `defence` (the `defense` / `defenseBuff` pair as one arm) 1,143 agree, with 5 views held by
 *    the bag alone and every one of them a map of ZEROS — Fortify Pack's eleven `0@ranged_buff_def`
 *    entries and Superior Invisibility's one. The reader declines them and the retired branch
 *    credited `0`, so no total moves; what changes is that a breakdown row stops appearing for a
 *    power that contributes nothing;
 *  - `defenseBuffSuppressible` 97 agree and 12 are GAINS, all of them Personal Force Field on
 *    rebirth and Thunderspy, whose +7.5 suppressible defence those forks' bags never carried.
 *
 * The re-key is the part worth stating twice. `effects.defense` had exactly one supplier on any
 * fork and it was not the converter: **0 converted powers carry the slot**, and the only writer
 * is `buffPetAuraEffects`. Retiring the data read while the fold still wrote the old key would
 * have zeroed every buff-pet defence aura in silence — the SYNTH-1 shape, in the one place this
 * repo could have walked into it. The fold mints `defenseBuff` now, so a pet aura and a mode
 * conditional reach the arm the same way.
