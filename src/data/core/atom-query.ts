/**
 * Plan B, Phase 1 — atom-native read primitives for the calc.
 *
 * The calc currently asks the `PowerEffects` bag "what is in slot X". Every slot
 * is single-valued, so whenever two distinct game effects route to the same slot
 * the projection must either pick a winner (collapse — the bug family) or mint a
 * discriminator: a parallel slot (`*Unenhanced`), or a flag bolted onto the value
 * (`unresistable`, `durationVariants`, `toWho`). Each such discriminator is a
 * property of the *atom*; the bag forces it to be re-materialized once per effect
 * type, by hand, forever.
 *
 * These helpers let the calc ask the other question instead — "give me the atoms
 * of effectType X" — and handle the discriminators explicitly. Each helper below
 * encapsulates exactly ONE of the axes the bag flattens:
 *
 *   bag representation            axis                    helper
 *   ───────────────────────────── ─────────────────────── ──────────────────────
 *   `*Unenhanced` parallel slots  IgnoreStrength          `enhanceableVsNot`
 *   `unresistable: true` flag     resistible              `resistibleTwins`
 *   `durationVariants[]`          duration                `durationBuckets`
 *   `toWho: 'Self'` flag          eToWho                  `selfDirected`
 *   slot name                     effectType/subType      `byType` / `atomsOfType`
 *
 * Read-only and side-effect free: nothing here mutates a `Power` or an atom.
 * Phase 1 adds no calc consumer — the appliers migrate one at a time in Phase 2,
 * each behind the shadow compare (`scripts/planb-shadow-bag.cjs`).

/**
 * The atom-native `regenBuff` / `regenBuffUnenhanced` and `recoveryBuff` /
 * `recoveryBuffUnenhanced` — the LAST two of the five `*Unenhanced` twin slots the
 * bag minted for the single `ignoreStrength` axis (Slice 5 folded `maxHPBuff`; ToHit's
 * and movement's remain). Shared by {@link regenBuffValue} and {@link recoveryBuffValue},
 * which differ only in `effectType`.
 *
 * These are the hardest resource slots to reconstruct because the bag's value depends
 * on several behaviors that never reach the wire atom. Two of those are recovered by a
 * converter stamp added in this slice ({@link AtomicEffect.notOnCaster}, and the
 * redirect-path `perTarget` stamp-gap fix); the rest are handled here, and the two that
 * cannot be settled without a game-correctness call are deliberately PUNTED to the bag:
 *
 *   1. **notOnCaster** — Thunderspy's resource target-trap (Equip Thugs, Disrupting
 *      Torrent): the bag deletes the slot, so the caster's total must skip these atoms.
 *   2. **increments are always enhanceable** — an atom carrying a converter-stamped
 *      `perTarget` routes to the ENHANCEABLE slot regardless of its own `ignoreStrength`,
 *      because the converter's classifier does (`mergeStackingPatches` patches
 *      `regenBuff`/`recoveryBuff`, never the twin). Reactive Regeneration's increment is
 *      an IgnoreStrength pseudo-pet buff; routing it by its own flag would both strip
 *      `regenBuff`'s `perTarget` and mint a phantom `regenBuffUnenhanced`.
 *   3. **N=1 excludes IgnoreStrength self-increments** — the `!ignoreStrength` test is
 *      the atom-derivable discriminator between **Consume/Devour Psyche** (a
 *      non-IgnoreStrength RefreshToCount self-increment, counted at one target → 0.85)
 *      and **Reactive Regeneration** (an IgnoreStrength pseudo-pet increment, not
 *      counted → 2, +per foe after).
 *   4. **`foldResourceSlot` SUM semantics** — unlike defense/resistance (last-write-wins)
 *      and maxHP (Replace-collapsed), a resource slot RAW-SUMS its same-table entries and
 *      RESETS on a table change (Obscure Sustenance's recovery: 0.6+0.38+0.1 = 1.08).
 *
 * ONE PUNT lives here, BPORT11 closed it, and EXPRPUNT-1 reopened it: **any
 * `Expression`-typed resource atom returns `undefined`.** The converter's RESOURCES guard
 * drops `Expression` templates whose effect-group `Chance` is 0 — a marker the game never
 * fires — and keeps the rest, but it CONSUMES that discriminator: `templatesToAtoms` writes
 * a clamped `baseProbability: 1` onto the phantom and the genuine row alike, so the wire
 * cannot tell them apart. That was the original punt's reason and it is still true.
 *
 * BPORT11 closed it on two measurements, and both were wrong:
 *
 *  1. **"The reconstructed value equals the bag's on all 36."** It does, and that proves
 *     nothing, because the slot it equals is an ADMISSION TICKET. The engine's comment on
 *     the same seam says it outright — "its scale never reached the total, and its table
 *     only fed the `Res_Boolean` guard". What this helper returns for an HP-scaling row is
 *     `{scale: 1, table: 'Melee_Ones'}`, and that is `@StdResult`: the expression's INPUT,
 *     not its output. Spent as a magnitude it reads +100% at every health level, where the
 *     program says 5% regen / 36% recovery at full health and 105% regen at zero.
 *  2. **"Every Expression resource atom that reaches this reader..."** The census walked
 *     BASE atoms, so it never saw the 18 `gated` Rebirth toggle markers — Stealth, Tough,
 *     Weave, Combat Jumping, the Kheldian and Stone shields — which are the phantoms the
 *     punt was written for and the @Redlynne "+100% Recovery (2s)" report it answers
 *     (`converter-recovery-marker.test.ts`). They carry `baseProbability: 1` like everything
 *     else and are held out of this reader by `gated` alone: an unrelated axis, and a
 *     coincidence rather than a discriminator.
 *
 * The whole live population, measured over all four forks, is seven programs:
 * Gamma Boost's two `kHitPoints% source>` rows (4 forks each, the only genuine
 * caster-facing pair), Defibrillate's `magnitudeExpression: null` / `scale: 30` row — a
 * DURATION multiplier in a magnitude slot, held out only by `toWho: Target` — Fortify Pack's
 * and Disrupting Torrent's target-side reads, and the 18 gated `endurancecost
 * power.boosted>` markers. One of seven is a number this reader could spend, and its shape
 * is not `scale × table`.
 *
 * So an Expression atom owes this helper NOTHING, and the answer it does owe has a
 * different shape and a different home: `coh_math::appliers::hp_scaling_resource`
 * evaluates `magnitudeExpression` against the caster's current-HP%, admits only the
 * `kHitPoints% source>` + `@StdResult` readers, and returns Indeterminate — never a
 * fabricated number — for the other six programs. That reader is where Gamma Boost's
 * magnitude is computed, and the engine is what every shipped total is drawn from; the
 * TS totals paths are oracles that carry no current-HP% state to spend it with. The
 * population above is pinned by `resources-expression-punt` in the verify test, which is
 * the tripwire BPORT11's note claimed and never wrote.
 *
 * A SECOND punt used to live here, on the `StackByAttribAndKey` burst/tail family (Icy
 * Bastion), because the bag answered that shape two different ways: regen's routing
 * skipped the lingering `4 @ 30s` (reporting +6, the 0.75s burst alone) while recovery,
 * which never had that skip, summed its `2 @ 0.75s` + `2 @ 30s` to +4. That
 * inconsistency was correctly read as a latent BAG BUG rather than a settled value, so
 * the helper declined to reconstruct it. **The bug is now fixed at the converter** (the
 * skip was keying on a flag that means "refresh, don't stack", not "ignore me" — see the
 * regen routing in `convert-powerset.cjs`), regen and recovery both sum, and the punt is
 * gone: this family reconstructs through {@link foldResourceSum} like any other. Icy
 * Bastion is +10 regen / +4 recovery while its toggle is up, confirmed in-game and by the
 * power's own `display_help`. The lesson generalizes — a punt that exists to dodge an
 * inconsistency is a bug report, not a design.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` for a power with no such atom, and for the Expression punt. Neither
 * is a fallback any more: the bag it used to abstain TO is stripped on both sides, so an
 * abstention here is a stated decline, and the caller that needs the number reads it from
 * the engine. Verified bag-equal corpus-wide for every value it DOES return by
 * `scripts/planb-shadow-resources.cjs` (punts are reported, not gated).
