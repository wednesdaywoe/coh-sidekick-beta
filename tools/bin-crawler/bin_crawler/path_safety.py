"""Is a parsed binary string safe to use as one path segment — SECURITY_AUDIT.md F78.

`export_powers.py` builds `exported_powers/<category>/<powerset>/` out of two
strings read from powers.bin, and every gate downstream treats that tree as
ground truth. Nothing between the binary and the filesystem looks at them: a
category of `..` writes a directory up, and `exported_powers/` is a trust root
nothing hashes, so the write leaves no trace to find afterwards either.

Wired into `_write_power_tree` at two call sites, and WHAT THAT COST is the part
worth reading. `_export_fingerprint.py` hashes `export_powers.py` byte for byte
and the `staleness` check in `tools/export-integrity.py` asserts every
dataset's recorded fingerprint equals the current source's, so adding the import
declared all four committed exports stale and the only green path back was
re-running the export
from the gitignored `.pigg` archives. That was done: the wiring is provably
inert, zero of the 79,297 committed power files moved, and the whole diff is
this call plus a fingerprint bump in fourteen manifests.

This module WAS outside that fingerprint — the glob was `parser/**/*.py` plus
the exporter entry modules, and this file is neither — so a change to the rule
below changed what the exporter writes with no staleness gate to notice. F78's
second half closed that by widening the glob to every `.py` in the package, so
this file, `assets_dir.py` and every other helper an exporter imports are now
inside it. `tests/test_export_path_components.py` still grades the rule against
the whole committed tree rather than leaning on the fingerprint: a fingerprint
says the tree was written by this exporter, and the sweep says every name in it
is a name.
