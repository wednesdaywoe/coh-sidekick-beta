/**
 * PROD1 — regenerate the engine artifacts the beta ships on top of.
 *
 * Replaces the manual spike commands with one repeatable step:
 *   1. Verify the installed `wasm-bindgen` CLI matches the version the rebuild's
 *      Cargo.lock resolved (the CLI and the linked lib MUST be identical or the glue
 *      it emits is incompatible with the .wasm) — fail loud otherwise.
 *   2. Build `coh_wasm` for wasm32 and run `wasm-bindgen` twice: `--target web` into
 *      src/engine/wasm/ (the browser glue engine.ts imports) and `--target nodejs` into
 *      src/engine/wasm-node/ (the artifact the src/engine/ parity gates load). Both, because
 *      a run that refreshed only the browser one left every gate grading a stale engine —
 *      a Rust change could then read as "the engine does nothing" with no failure anywhere.
 *   3. Copy the rebuild's per-dataset contract bundles into public/engine/contract/
 *      as <server>.json.gz (what engine.ts fetches at boot).
 *
 * The rebuild repo is located via COH_REBUILD_DIR (or --rebuild-dir), defaulting to the
 * sibling `coh-sidekick-experiment` checkout. Every input is verified before use; a missing rebuild, a version skew,
 * or a missing bundle aborts with a specific message rather than emitting a half-built engine.
 *
 * `--verify` runs steps 1 and 2 into a scratch directory and compares what came out against
 * the committed artifacts instead of replacing them (STALE-3). It writes nothing into the
 * beta tree. That mode exists so a machine which is NOT the one that wrote the manifest can
 * rebuild and grade the bytes: every hash in `_engine_manifest.json` is taken of the file the
 * writer had just produced, so it agrees by construction and can never be the evidence that
 * the build reproduces. Only a second build somewhere else is.
 *
 * It lives HERE rather than in a gate script of its own because the two must build alike. The
 * remap flags below are derived per host, and STALE-3's own arm F is the lesson: it logged the
 * bytes it produced and not the flags that produced them, so its number was unreproducible
 * three days later. A verifier that spells the flags a second time is arm F with a green tick.
