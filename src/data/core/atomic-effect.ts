/**
 * DSH4 — Closed atomic effect schema + canonical identity key.
 *
 * Source of truth: streams/DEDUCTIVE_SCHEMA_HARNESS.md. This encodes the Mids /
 * game / bin-parser atomic model — a power is a **flat array of atomic,
 * single-attrib effect records**, a compound effect = N sibling records
 * distinguished by damageType / mezType / pvMode / resistible. It is the schema the
 * converter's bag-of-~90-named-slots `PowerEffects` will be *projected from* (DSH6),
 * and the shape the oracle harness keys on (DSH5). This file defines the record, the
 * attrib→type bridge, and the identity keys — it does NOT yet rewrite the converter
 * (that is DSH6) nor read the Mids oracle (DSH5).
 *
 * Field provenance (each `AtomicEffect` field ← Mids `Effect` / bin-export template):
 *   effectType/subType ← export `attribs[]` string via `bridgeAttrib` (Mids splits
 *                        these into `EffectType` + `DamageType`/`MezType` natively).
 *   pvMode             ← export effect-group `is_pvp` (Mids `PvMode`/ePvX).
 *   resistible         ← NOT template `flags[].IgnoreResistance` (Mids `Resistible`).
 *   toWho              ← export template `target` (Mids `ToWho`/eToWho); replaces the
 *                        ad-hoc `selfPenalty` bag flag.
 *   attribType/aspect  ← export template `type`/`aspect` (Mids `AttribType`/`Aspect`).
 *   modifierTable      ← export template `table` (Mids `ModifierTable`).
 *   scale              ← export template `scale`, SIGN PRESERVED (the converter's
 *                        `makeEffect` does `Math.abs` at ingest — we stop that here).
 *   magnitude/duration/ticks/stacking/... ← the corresponding template fields.
 *   specialCase/conditionals ← group `requires_expression` gate (Mids
 *                        `SpecialCase`+`ActiveConditionals`); replaces the `domination`
 *                        bag bolt-on.

   * `requiresExpression` is placed by: ~1.6k of Homecoming's atoms are `Meta`,
