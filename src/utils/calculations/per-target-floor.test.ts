/**
 * An untouched targets-hit slider must not delete a base the game gives unconditionally.
 *
 * Phalanx Fighting is `EntsAffected kLeaguemate, kCaster` over a 12-foot sphere with
 * `maxTargets 3`: an unconditional `Replace` base of 0.5 beside a `target ≠ source` increment of
 * 0.3. The caster fills the first of those three seats for as long as the power is on, so N never
 * reaches zero — and reading the untouched slider as "no foes" deleted the 5% melee/ranged/AoE
 * defence the game hands out with no ally in sight (PERFOE-3, filed from a beta bug report).
 *
 * Guarded Spin is the second shape, and it is a CLICK rather than an always-on power (PERFOE-4,
 * filed from a Thunderspy report: "does not show in the dashboard when toggled on. I checked every
 * AT it's available for"). Its `EntsAffected` is `kFoe` alone, so the seat above says nothing about
 * it, and its +Def(Melee, Lethal) is one `kStackType_Stack` mod aimed at the caster which the game
 * applies once per foe the cone lands on — the per-foe growth is real. The empty count is not:
 * `character_tick.c` refuses a queued power outright when the target entity is null or of the wrong
 * type, and a cone range-checks that same entity before firing. So a foe-aimed power that fired had
 * a foe in front of it, and the one count it could not be at is the one an untouched slider meant.
 *
 * The engine is where the shipped number comes from and `coh_math::stacking` is graded there
 * (`per_target_floor.rs`, plus the two `Per-target floor` totals fixtures). This is the TS half:
 * the oracle's arithmetic, and the slider control that has to agree with it about where its axis
 * starts.
