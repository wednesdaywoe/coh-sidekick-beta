/**
 * The display effects bag (PROD6C-3a).
 *
 * `RegistryEffectsDisplay` does not render a power's authored `effects` — it renders a bag
 * the surfaces BUILD at the render edge, and InfoPanel, PowerInfoTooltip and
 * CompareSlottingModal each built their own. This is that build, extracted once so there is a
 * single bag, and so the engine's `granted.rs` has one shape to mirror instead of three that
 * disagreed with each other.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of the power object — the transforms PROD6C-3 enumerates
 * as (2) the merged `stats`, (3) healing extracted from the damage array and (5) the flattened
 * `movement` object. Transform (4), `buffDuration` backfilled from a summon's duration, was
 * REMOVED 2026-09-07 and is described below. Two further transforms live below it rather than
 * inside it, because each runs on the built bag: (6) per-target scaling, which reads UI state, and (7) the pseudo-pet merge.
 * The one transform that stays at the call sites is the redirect / quick-snipe / conditional
 * merge that decides WHICH power this is.
 *
 * Two divergences between the surfaces are settled here rather than preserved (counts are
 * powers per fork over the deduped runtime corpus, homecoming / rebirth / thunderspy):
 *
 * * `arc` is converted to degrees from whichever partition carries it. Primary/secondary
 *   powers store the raw binary radians on `stats.arc` and pool/epic powers on
 *   `effects.arc` (`transformPoolPower` builds no `stats`), and the registry row is a
 *   `degrees` one — the tooltip read only `stats.arc` and so rendered a pool power's radian
 *   value into a degrees row (48 / 42 / 46 powers).
 * * `buffDuration` from a summon's duration was InfoPanel-only (297 / 273 / 280 powers). It is
 *   gone (2026-09-07). Its guard — "only where the power states no duration of its own" — read
 *   `effects.buffDuration`, which STRIP-1 removed from every power on every fork, so the guard
 *   became universally true and the backfill fired on every summon power: measured at 110 / 111 /
 *   120 / 119 powers per fork, and 100% of the bag's surviving `buffDuration` values. That put a
 *   pet's lifespan into the slot that means the power's own effect clock, where it collided with
 *   the engine's answer for the same key — the two are different quantities and the slot holds
 *   one (PROD6B-BETA-PARITY class 2). The lifespan has its own home on all three surfaces, via
 *   `formatSummonDuration`, which also states the 99999s "permanent" sentinel as words.
 *
 * The tooltip's six `flySpeed` / `runSpeed` / `jumpSpeed` / `jumpHeight` / `regeneration` /
 * `recovery` top-level mappings and its `effects.endurance` fallback are NOT carried over:
 * measured across all three forks, no power carries any of those keys at the top level of a
 * runtime bag (`transformPoolPower` destructures `endurance` away into the renamed
 * `enduranceCost`), so they are dead rather than divergent.

/**
 * The stacking slider a surface offers for this power, or `null` for one that offers none —
 * `has_stacking_slider` / `adjust_display_bag` in the engine's `stacking.rs` are the twin.
 *
 * Two mechanics share the one control. An AoE power whose effects carry a per-foe increment
 * slides on TARGETS HIT; a power whose atoms self-stack slides on the STACK COUNT. Per-target
 * wins where a power has both (Soul Drain self-stacks on a double-cast and grows per foe, and
 * the per-foe story is the dominant one for tooltip math), so the smaller stack cap cannot
 * shrink the targets axis.
 *
 * **Both arms read the ATOMS.** They read the authored `effects` object until STACKINFO-1, and
 * the function opened with `if (!power.effects) return null` — sound while that object was the
 * display bag's source, and starvation the moment it was not. STRIP-1 emptied it: no power on
 * any fork carries an authored `perTarget`, a `maxStacks` or a `stackInterval` any more, so this
 * returned `null` for the entire corpus and every surface stopped offering the slider. It read
 * as a corpus with no stacking powers rather than as a reader with no input, which is why the
 * one gate over it went green having graded nothing (`powerProjectionParity`).
 *
 * The atom-native reading is WIDER than the bag's on the stack arm and that is the correction,
 * not a side effect: a power states its own cap on its atoms, where the converter minted a
 * `maxStacks` slot for only some of them. It is NARROWER on four powers, which is the other half
 * of the same correction — ATOM-BAG-3's delay schedules, a `Replace` shield re-applied every few
 * seconds that the bag recorded as a stack of 7. Those no longer offer a slider for a shield that
 * never doubles, and the `Stacks (every Xs)` label that described their cadence went with them:
 * its `stackInterval` came from the same writer, and no other power ever had one.
 *
 * `minStacks` is where the axis STARTS, and two shapes cannot start it at zero. The floor is
 * {@link perTargetCountCannotBeZero}, the same predicate the engine and the totals path floor the
 * count with, rather than a term this function spells by hand:
 *
 *  - A power whose effects land on the caster as well as on whoever else is in radius fills the
 *    first of its `maxTargets` seats for as long as it is running. Phalanx Fighting gives its 5%
 *    melee/ranged/AoE defence solo, and a slider reading "Off" there described a state the power
 *    is never in (PERFOE-3).
 *  - A power the game refuses to fire without an entity in its sights reached at least one of
 *    them if it was used at all. Guarded Spin is the reported case: a Staff Fighting cone whose
 *    +Def(Melee, Lethal) the game stacks once per foe it lands on, so its growth is real — but the
 *    slider it needed opened at "Off", and toggling the power on moved no defence on the dashboard
 *    for anyone who did not know to look for it (PERFOE-4).
 *
 * The stacks arm keeps 0: N there counts casts, and a click the build has not fired is off.
