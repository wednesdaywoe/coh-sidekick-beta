/**
 * Slotted damage-proc contribution per cast — the single source for the
 * "+proc" damage shown on the DamageBlock and folded into the Attack Chain
 * builder's DPS. Extracted from DamageBlock so the two can't diverge.
 *
 * Proc damage is FLAT in CoH: it is NOT modified by damage IOs slotted in the
 * power, nor by damage-strength buffs (Fury/Build Up/Aim/Musculature). A proc
 * fires at its fixed scale-table value. Proc *chance* uses the power's base
 * recharge shrunk by its own slotted recharge and widened back out by the
 * build's global — `base × (1 + global) / (1 + global + local)`. Global alone
 * cancels, which is why the older reading "global recharge never affects PPM
 * rolls" held for as long as nobody slotted recharge in the power; once they do,
 * global softens the penalty. Measured 2026-08-02 (DATA-GAP-REGISTER PPM-2).
