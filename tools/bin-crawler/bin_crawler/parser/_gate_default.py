"""Is an effect group's `Requires` satisfied in the default situation?

A gated group is either part of the power's unconditional base or a branch that
only applies under some condition. Deciding which needs an answer to "is this
gate true when nothing special is going on?", and that needs the expression's
STRUCTURE — its root operator and how each leaf sits under it.

The converter used to answer it with `stripped.endsWith('!')`: read the last
token of the `&&`-flattened expression as if it were the top-level operator.
That holds for a conjunction of negations ("no combo level active", "not in a
raid" — genuinely the default state) and is backwards when the `!` negates only
ONE conjunct. Rebirth Guardian's Dispersion Bubble carries `isPVPMap? entref
target> entref source> eq ! &&` — "on a PvP map AND target is not self" — where
the root operator is `&&`, and its whole PvP-only defence set landed in base.
Two facets were patched by hand; 3,230 groups across 223 expressions were
exposed (DATA-GAP-REGISTER COND-1).

So parse the expression and evaluate it, three-valued, under an explicit
DEFAULT SITUATION — what is true of a character standing in ordinary PvE
content with nothing switched on:

    caster    the BUILD — one of the dataset's own player archetypes, unmezzed,
              at full HP and endurance, every meter and combo counter at zero,
              no mode active, owning no temp power, token or entitlement, no
              event fired recently, not flying, movement and recharge unbuffed
    target    a generic living critter at full HP, unmezzed, and NOT the caster,
              not a friend, in no named enemy group, wearing no named costume
              and answering to no named villain — the things a specific target
              would have, a generic one does not
    world     an ordinary PvE map: not a PvP map, no zone event, no mission
              script state, no hard-mode challenge, not on a task force
    the hit   landed. `@ForceHit` reads true, because a planner shows what a
              power does when it connects
    unknowns  the caster's LEVEL, the target's RANK, and every to-hit or `rand`
              ROLL — the export cannot see a build's level or a specific target,
              and guessing one is how a rank fork's two halves end up in the
              same slot

A tree that evaluates TRUE is the power's base case. FALSE (a state that is off
by default) and INDETERMINATE are both conditional: the converter's job is to
keep them out of base, not to pick a winner.

Two things this deliberately does NOT do:

  * It does not decide display policy — with one named exception, kept because
    it was the converter's settled verdict and not COND-1's to re-open:
    `_leech_target_state`. Everything else here is a game reading.
  * It does not pick ONE archetype for the caster. `arch source> Class_Scrapper
    eq` on a pool power is base for a Scrapper and not for anyone else, and one
    boolean cannot say that. So the tree is evaluated once per player archetype
    the dataset defines, and a group whose verdict differs between them reports
    INDETERMINATE_ARCHETYPE carrying the archetypes it IS base for
    ([`GateVerdict.archetypes`]) — a resolution the consumer applies to the
    build it is showing, not a flavour of unknown (DATA-GAP-REGISTER AT-FORK-1).

Not a duplicate of the engine's evaluator. `crates/coh_math/src/expr.rs` walks
the same RPN to answer "given THIS target, is the gate true?", which needs a
target. This runs at export time with no target at all, which is why it asks
what holds by default rather than what is true.
