/**
 * BPORT11 cluster 4 — the movement cluster, read off the atoms and graded against the bag.
 *
 * Three separate reads that had to move together, because they share one axis vocabulary and
 * two of them are halves of the same authored pair.
 *
 * **The five scalar slots go, and they were never carriers.** `runSpeed`, `runSpeedUnenhanced`,
 * `flySpeed`, `jumpHeight` and `jumpSpeed` have 0 powers on all four forks. The comment those
 * blocks carried named Sprint, Ninja Run and Beast Run as the powers reaching the calc that way;
 * those hand-authored inherents carry no bag at all and their movement is atom-native through
 * the axis map. BPORT1 had already filed `flySpeed` as zero-supply and left the other four as
 * `leave`, because the supply census could not see that their only supplier was a display mint
 * the totals path never reaches.
 *
 * **The axis map's data branch had exactly one carrier, and fork resolution takes it.**
 * `movementBuffValue` returns an ARRAY — usually empty — for any power with a movement atom,
 * and `??` keeps an empty array, so the bag branch only ever fired where the reader answered
 * `undefined`. Across 14,249 powers that is one power: rebirth Acrobatics, whose atoms fork by
 * class (AT-FORK-1), so a build-agnostic read saw none of them. Read through `mezSourceFor` it
 * answers with the same jumpHeight/jumpSpeed the bag holds, and the data branch is left with no
 * carrier at all.
 *
 * **The combat-debuff gate is a swap of instrument, not of verdict.** It asked whether two
 * sibling SLOTS were absent; `carries_combat_debuff` asks the atoms on the discriminators that
 * decide it. They agree on all 18,239 power×class views.
 *
 * **The self-penalty pair is where numbers actually move**, and every move is a self penalty the
 * converter's `toWho` tagging lost rather than a value the reader invented. Rebirth and
 * Thunderspy's Granite Armor and Rooted state their jump root as `JumpHeight -500 toWho:Target`
 * on a Self-target toggle — the "target" of a self-cast toggle IS the caster, which is why
 * `reachesCaster` consults the power's recipients — and the bag's untagged entry was dropped by
 * the `isSelfDirectedEffect` gate. So the root those two powers are named for reached no total
 * on two of the four forks. The block also grew its second half: `movementCapDebuff` is the
 * Maximum face of the same penalty, split out of `slow` by ENT-5, and this calc never grew the
 * read — 312 powers carry the slot and none was ever spent.
 *
 * Mutation-tested four ways, all red: routing the recipient question off the ROW rather than the
 * power (which is what loses Granite's root), routing the cap debuff off the Current face,
 * dropping `capEntries`' self-only gate, and stopping `carries_combat_debuff` discriminating on
 * aspect so ToHit-debuff RESISTANCE reads as a ToHit debuff.
