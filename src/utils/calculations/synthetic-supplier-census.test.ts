/**
 * BPORT11 — the suppliers a data-seam retirement cannot see, and the arms that must survive it.
 *
 * `power.effects` has five suppliers and BPORT7's regen empties exactly one of them. Two of the
 * other four are built by the totals pass itself: `expandActiveConditionals` turns an active
 * stance or mode into a synthetic power whose `effects` object is the conditional's own, and
 * `expandBuffPetAuras` folds a toggled pet's aura into a second one. Neither synthetic carries
 * `atoms` — there is nothing to carry, the value is minted here — so an atom-native arm answers
 * `undefined` for every one of them.
 *
 * A family that retires its bag branch outright therefore reads 0 for its whole synthetic
 * population, and reads it silently: no exception, no unmapped key, just a Bio Armor stance
 * that stops contributing. {@link syntheticEffects} is the branch that keeps them, named so it
 * is distinguishable from the DATA read beside it.
 *
 * **This is not hypothetical, and it is why the census below is a guard rather than a note.**
 * The canonical fork retired its bag branches in one pass and dropped the synthetic arm on ten
 * slots its own conditionals still mint — the same four datasets ship in both repos, so the
 * populations are identical. Measured through each arm's own credit gate: recoveryBuffUnenhanced
 * 110, regenBuffUnenhanced 95, maxHPBuffUnenhanced 43, enduranceDiscount 29, tohitBuff 25,
 * rechargeBuff 20, slow 12, maxEndBuff 6, knockback / immobilize / knockup 4 each,
 * perceptionBuff / rangeBuff / mezResistance 2 each, maxHPBuff 1 — 359 credited contributions,
 * every one of them a named Bio Armor, Temporal Manipulation, Dual Blades or Kheldian stance.
 * Its pet-aura fold was re-keyed from `effects.defense` to `effects.defenseBuff` so the defence
 * arm kept working. This repo's fold did the same at BPORT11c's defence carry, and it did it
 * because the pin below went red — `effects.defense` has no converted carrier on any fork, so
 * the fold was its only supplier and the old key would have gone quiet.
 *
 * So the invariant, checked against the oracle's source: a slot with a credited synthetic
 * supplier is read either through the bag (not carried yet) or through `syntheticEffects`
 * (carried, arm kept) — never through neither. It grades the arms as they are written, so each
 * remaining cluster inherits the check without an edit here.
