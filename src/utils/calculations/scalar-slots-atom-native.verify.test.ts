/**
 * BPORT11 cluster 1 — the seven scalar families, read off the atoms.
 *
 * **BPORT13 restated it.** This was a two-armed comparison and BPORT7 removed one arm: with
 * `power.effects` gone every `bagOnly` is empty, every `agree` is zero, and the whole corpus
 * falls into `atomOnly`. Three of the four buckets therefore passed vacuously while the other
 * two went red — the worse half being the ones that stayed green.
 *
 * What survives is not nothing. The bag was the oracle that MINTED these carrier counts, and a
 * number outlives the oracle that established it: `accuracyBuff` agreeing on 56 carriers and
 * nothing else is the same fact as `accuracyBuff` having exactly 56 atom carriers, once the
 * bag holds none. So each arm below is now a one-armed census pinned to the count its own
 * comparison produced, plus a floor asserting the bag arm really is empty — which keeps the
 * retired half honest rather than assumed, and reds if a supplier ever refills it.
 *
 * The counts are pinned PER FORK rather than as a total. A total is not a roster: it survives a
 * power moving between forks, and cross-fork movement is where this corpus actually drifts.
 *
 * That restatement immediately earned itself. `rechargeBuff` was documented as 309 agreements
 * plus 25 Thunderspy-only gains, so the census should read 334; it reads 309. The 25 left when
 * `atom-query.ts` was ported wholesale from canonical (STACK-7, 2026-08-27) and arrived
 * carrying `slowIsDebuff`, ten days before the strip. They were never a recovery: Time Wall,
 * the named example, states its −recharge as a `Ranged_Slow` row at `toWho: Target`, and the
 * pre-port reader credited the CASTER with a foe's debuff — the identical defect this file's
 * own header describes for `maxEndBuffValue` two paragraphs down, in a sibling family, found
 * the same way. The port fixed it and nothing said so, because the comparison that would have
 * said so was already red for a different reason. The 25 are recorded here as falsified.
 *
 * This was the comparison BPORT7 destroys. The regen that empties `power.effects` also empties
 * the shadow oracle every one of these arms was checked against, so a carry landing after the
 * strip can only be checked against itself. Canonical hit exactly that on `shouldShowToggle`
 * and had to re-derive the roster from a pre-strip checkout. The order here is the lesson:
 * migrate first, grade against the incumbent, then strip.
 *
 * Six of the seven agree with the bag on every carrier of every fork. The two that do not are
 * the reason the comparison is worth running:
 *
 *  - **`maxEndBuffValue` credited the caster with the foe's drain.** Soul Consumption states
 *    `-1 Target` beside its `+1 Self` and the reader's `Math.abs` fold summed both, answering
 *    2 where the bag, the game and the Rust twin all say 1 — four powersets on two forks. Its
 *    Rust counterpart (`coh_math::appliers::resources::max_endurance_buff_value`) has carried
 *    the recipient test since ATOM8; the TypeScript half never grew it, and nothing compared
 *    the two until this carry. Fixed in `atom-query.ts`, pinned below.
 *  - **`rechargeBuffValue` answered for 25 powers the Thunderspy bag never held.** Recorded
 *    at the time as the migration working. It was not — see the BPORT13 note above; those 25
 *    were foe `*_Slow` rows credited to the caster, and `slowIsDebuff` has since declined them.
 *    1,039 powers carry such a row and 1,042 of the atoms are `toWho: Target`. The nine that
 *    are not all belong to Reaction Time, a PBAoE whose every foe row has an exact negative
 *    twin aimed at `Self` — the caster's carve-out from its own field, not a caster buff — so
 *    declining the family whole is right on both populations.
 *
 * The seventh is `elusivity`, which BPORT1 filed as zero-supply. Both arms confirm it from
 * their own side: no power on any fork carries the bag entry, and no power carries an atom the
 * reader would return. The arm is kept rather than deleted precisely because it is empty — a
 * reader that answers the day a fork ships one beats a deletion somebody has to notice.
