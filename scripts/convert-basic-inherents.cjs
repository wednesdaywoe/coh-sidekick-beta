/**
 * Convert the universal inherent powers — the ones every character is handed
 * regardless of archetype — from raw game JSON → a per-fork generated module.
 *
 * These are Brawl, Sprint, Rest, the free travel toggles (Ninja / Beast /
 * Athletic Run) and the prestige sprints — the last hand-authored powers in the
 * planner. `datasets/homecoming/levels.ts` spelled out their scales, tables and
 * endurance by hand, and because only Homecoming has a `levels.ts`, every fork
 * got Homecoming's copy. That cost four shipped wrong numbers, all of them
 * things the export states plainly (DATA-GAP-REGISTER INHERENT-4, INHERENT-5,
 * INHERENT-8).
 *
 * WHICH powers: the address list below, one entry per power the planner offers.
 * That list is curation, not derivation, and it is the only hand-held thing here
 * — no structural predicate separates "the sprint you slot" from the forty
 * vanity pets and costume toggles that share `Inherent.Inherent` and its
 * auto-issue flag. Everything the planner then SAYS about a power (its type,
 * endurance, atoms, slots, allowed enhancements, icon, help text) is read off
 * the record.
 *
 * WHICH fork: each entry is resolved against the fork being converted, and a
 * fork that holds none of an entry's addresses emits nothing for it. That is the
 * INHERENT-4 fix — Thunderspy has no Ninja Run, Beast Run or Athletic Run
 * anywhere in its export, and was being offered all three.
 *
 * Homecoming states its two P2W runs as an `Auto` granter whose only templates
 * are `Revoke_Power` on itself and `Grant_Power` aimed at the real toggle in the
 * `Prestige` category. `followGrant` walks that hop, so what gets emitted is the
 * toggle the character actually runs rather than the bookkeeping power that
 * hands it over. Rebirth authors the same power inline, with no hop.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/convert-basic-inherents.cjs --dataset homecoming
 *   node scripts/convert-basic-inherents.cjs --dataset homecoming --dry-run

/**
 * The powers the planner offers, by the address each fork files them under.
 *
 * `addresses` is tried in order and the first hit wins, so a fork that moved a
 * power between categories still resolves. The order matters in exactly one
 * place: Homecoming files Ninja and Beast Run in BOTH `Inherent.Inherent` (the
 * granter) and `Prestige.Prestige_Travel` (the toggle), and the granter is
 * listed first so `followGrant` does the walk and the emitted record carries the
 * granter's provenance. Athletic Run has no granter on any fork — the toggle is
 * handed over directly — so its only address is the Prestige one.
 *
 * `category` and `locked` are planner-side facts with no counterpart in the
 * game data: which picker tab the power renders under, and that the player
 * cannot un-grant it.
 *
 * Slot ceiling: a stated `max_boosts` is read literally, and export silence
 * decodes to six — not as a convention but as what the export means. The game's
 * parse table stamps 6 into the binary when the authored def says nothing
 * (powers_load.c `TOK_INT(BasePower, iMaxBoosts, 6)`), the exporter omits
 * exactly the value 6, and the engine enforces the stored value plus a
 * five-slot buy cap (`MAX_BOOSTS_BOUGHT`) that lands on the same six. So the
 * three travel toggles state `0` and mean it, and Sprint, Rest and the
 * prestige sprints are silent sixes. The hand table's four had no source and
 * is retired. Closed INHERENT-7 / MAXBOOST-1.
