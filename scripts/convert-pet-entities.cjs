//    (Caltrops stores Slow +0.8 but SpeedRunning -1.0 — both foe slows). Slow /
//    Speed* route to the app's single movement `Slow` (-Speed) bucket, matching
//    how convert-powerset.cjs classifies a mod on a `*_Slow` table.
//  • Sign-discriminated resource attribs — Res_DMG is +N for a pet SELF-buff
//    (survivability, e.g. blaster_time Res_DMG +2.0) and -N for a foe debuff
//    (Freezing Rain Res_DMG -1.0). Positive = self-buff → dropped (matches HC
//    dropping pet ResistAll self-buffs); negative = the foe debuff we surface.
//    Two of them are further gated to a REAL magnitude table: Thunderspy carries
//    Recovery and Endurance as bare MARKERS on a `*_Ones` placeholder table (the
//    actual -End rides the separate `EndDrain` attrib on a real `*_EndDrain`
//    table) whose scale is not a computable percentage — surfacing those printed
//    a meaningless ~100% (and mislabeled +Recovery ally-buffs like Adrenalin
//    Boost / Guardianship as "-Recovery").
//    That exclusion belongs to those two attribs, not to the `*_Ones` table: for
//    -Regeneration the `*_Ones` scale IS the magnitude, exactly as it is on the
//    Homecoming and Rebirth twins (Poison Gas -10 @Melee_Ones) and on the parent
//    route, where convert-powerset.cjs ships `regenDebuff` on `Ranged_Ones`. A
//    blanket table guard would have dropped every tspy pet -Regen, since all of
//    them ride `*_Ones` (ENT-7).
// The `debuff_*` keys are CATEGORY tokens — what a tspy effect element carries at its
// front. Since the parser began reading each AttribMod's own index array (TSPY-4) most
// of these arrive under their real HC attrib name instead (`Base_Defense`, `ToHit`, the
// movement stats), so both spellings must map: the token for the elements that still
// front one, the real name for the mods that now name themselves. Without the real
// names every location/patch pseudo-pet lost the -Def half again — Sleet's
// `Base_Defense 3.0 Melee_Debuff_Def` is byte-identical to its HC and Rebirth twins.

// fired on the attrib NAME alone, so a Resistance-aspect slow PROTECTION (Temporal
// Mending) published as a foe `-Speed`. `classifySlowFamily` runs for tspy too — the

// and mez resistance on `target: Self` templates. `isDebuffTemplate` rejects
// target=Self wholesale, so every one of them was parsed from the bin and then
// dropped — 352 of the entities a player power can summon have at least one. This
// is what "can I see my pet's stats" needs.
//
// Distinct from the faced vocabulary `templateFace`/`facedType` produce. Those come
// off rows the pet addresses to somebody else (`AnyAffected`), where the recipient —
// summoner or foe — is decided by the ABILITY's `targetsAffected` (ENT-12). These
// come off rows addressed to the pet itself, so there is no recipient question to
// ask: the stat is the pet's, full stop.
//
// CRITICAL — these MUST NOT reuse the `DefenseBuff`/`ResistanceBuff`/`Absorb` type
// names. Those are the ALLY-aura vocabulary below, and `buff_pets` folds them into
// the PLAYER's totals by exact type string. A pet's own +Res is not the player's
// +Res, and emitting it under the ally name would leak a pet stat onto the character
// sheet. Hence the `Self…` prefix, and a guard test that asserts the two

 * (extractDamage wants aspect=Absolute), not a resistance (that is aspect=Resistance), and
