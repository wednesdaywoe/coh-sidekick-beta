/**
 * Seams where canonical has ALREADY grown the atom arm and the beta has not.
 *
 * The stream doc scoped BPORT4 expecting "mostly leave, matching canonical". Per file that
 * reads right — both repos read the bag. Per SLOT it is the opposite: canonical calls
 * `movementCapBumpValue(p)` before it looks at `effects.movementCapBump`, and its
 * `character-totals` had no stack read left at all. So the answer for these is CARRY, not
 * leave, and the list is BPORT6's work order rather than a curiosity.
 *
 * A seam joining this map means canonical migrated something else and the beta is now one
 * more behind; a seam leaving it means the beta caught up, or — the case worth catching —
 * canonical grew a bag read back.
 *
 * **BPORT6 corrected the list twice before working it, both times downward.** The 33 seams
 * BPORT4 counted were 21:
 *
 *  - **Eight were a defect in the instrument.** A roster-bound seam (`effects[key]` over a
 *    `DOMINATION_MEZ_KEYS` loop) is minted from a hand-kept register, not found by the
 *    finder, and the sibling comparison ran the FINDER over canonical — which can never
 *    return a seam it did not produce. So every roster seam reported `migrated-there`
 *    unconditionally. Six of the eight were wrong: canonical's `getPowerDominationSummary`
 *    is byte-identical to this repo's and reads the same bag, so "carry canonical's arm"
 *    named an arm that does not exist. `siblingRosterVerdict` decides these on the symbol
 *    now. The other two were right — `ROUTED_SUBTYPES` really was deleted — and the register
 *    kept minting them anyway, which `assertSitesLive` now refuses.
 *  - **Four more are already adjudicated elsewhere.** `perma.ts`'s pair is the
 *    `authoredCycle` arm BPORT2 kept deliberately and pinned by census, and `inherents.ts`'s
 *    is `getDominationInfo` — canonical reads it off the inherent power through
 *    `@/data/archetype-inherent`, a module this fork does not have. Both wait on the same
 *    thing: PARTSTAT-2, the join from an archetype's declared inherent to the
 *    `Inherent.Inherent` power that holds it, which is canonical-only.
 *
 * What was left, and what BPORT6 carried: `power-row-utils` (the whole predicate, atom-native
 * — see `toggle-roster-atom-native.verify.test.ts`) and `character-totals`
 * (`collectStrengthBuffs` onto `specialBuffValue` + `stackCapOf`). The `summon` cluster was
 * BPORT7's by BPORT3's verdict — reader and writer crossed together once
 * `convert-powerset.cjs` lifted the slot — and left this map with the crossing: five files
 * dropped out, and what remains is BPORT6's pair, still waiting on PARTSTAT-2.

 * difference costs: at its strip, "Quantum Acceleration on all four forks and Energy Flight on

 * a frozen pre-strip dataset as its input, or its output frozen into fixtures. Both were priced
 * against "this file has no migrated twin to carry" — and it has one. PROD7 quarantined the
 * legacy calc under a new name on this side only; canonical never split its copy and migrated it
 * in place through its own STRIP-1. Every sibling question here is keyed by path, so the twin
 * answered `absent` 165 times and the census reported the strongest verdict available without
 * ever performing the lookup.
 *
 * What the resolved lookup says: canonical's copy is the same file (31 of the oracle's 34
 * declarations), it is the oracle behind `emit-totals-fixtures.ts` -> `totals_gate.rs`, and post
 * strip it reads the bag at six seams. So the answer is CARRY, on the BPORT6 pattern, and the
 * two freezes are the fallback nobody needs.
 *
 * These assertions are written as identities rather than as literals wherever the carry will
 * move them: the residual is "the slots canonical still reads", derived from canonical's own
 * source, so a family landing removes its rows here without an edit and canonical growing a bag
 * read back reds instead of passing.
