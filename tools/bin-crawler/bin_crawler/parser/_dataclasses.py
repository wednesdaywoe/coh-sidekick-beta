"""Data structures for parsed binary records.

Every `*_expression` / `*_requires` field below is a **token list**, because that
is what the wire holds: a string-offset array, one offset per token. The parser
used to join those tokens with spaces and let each consumer split them back
apart, which is lossless only while no token contains a space. Homecoming's
costume-FX values do — `Minimal FX`, `Color Tintable`, `Undefined Evil` and ten
more each sit in `powers.bin` as one standalone entry, and the join erased the
boundary the split then had to guess (DATA-GAP-REGISTER COND-8). Keeping the
list means nothing has to guess.
